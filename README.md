# Exploring the Causes of Heart Attacks in Youth: A Data-Driven Analysis  

---

## Objective of the Project  
The objective of this project is to analyze key medical and behavioral factors contributing to heart diseases in youth. The study focuses on variables such as cholesterol, triglycerides, diabetes, smoking, alcohol consumption, and physical activity to uncover correlations and derive actionable insights. The ultimate goal is to enable early intervention and preventive measures to reduce the prevalence of heart-related conditions among younger generations.

## KPIs (Key Performance Indicators)  
- **Average BMI**: 27.44  
- **Average Sleep Time**: 6.49 hours  
- **Number of Positive Patients**: 2,038  
- **Number of At-Risk Individuals**: 722  
- **Number of Patients with Typical Chest Pain**: 2,545

## Key Insights  
1. **Smoking Impact**: Regular and occasional smoking is correlated with higher cholesterol and triglyceride levels, increasing the risk of heart disease.  
2. **Alcohol Consumption**: Individuals consuming alcohol regularly show elevated triglyceride levels, which is a key risk factor.  
3. **Stress and Physical Activity**: Sedentary lifestyles are linked with higher stress levels, while moderate or high physical activity lowers stress risks.  
4. **Heart Disease and Diabetes**: A significant proportion of patients with heart disease also exhibit diabetes, highlighting the interplay between these conditions.  
5. **Demographics and Risk**: Young individuals with a family history of heart disease and high-risk behaviors (e.g., smoking and drinking) are more prone to developing heart conditions.

## Conclusion  
This project highlights the complex interplay between medical and behavioral factors contributing to heart diseases among youth. By identifying key risk factors like high cholesterol, triglycerides, and unhealthy lifestyle choices, this analysis provides actionable insights for preventive healthcare strategies. It also emphasizes the importance of promoting physical activity and stress management among young populations to mitigate heart-related risks.

## Abstract  
An alarming rise in heart disease among youth, traditionally associated with older populations, necessitates a deeper understanding of contributing factors. This project explores the role of modern lifestyle habits, dietary patterns, and stress levels in influencing heart health. Using Power BI for data visualization and analysis, this study uncovers correlations between medical conditions (cholesterol, diabetes) and behaviors (smoking, alcohol consumption, physical activity), offering valuable insights for early intervention and preventive measures.
